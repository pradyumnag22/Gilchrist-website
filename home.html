            <span> Adam Gilchrist is a player who should be remembered as being even better than his statistics suggest-a big statement, but a true one.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span> Throughout his career, Gilchrist was a renowned ‘walker’ and would often turn on his heels when he thought he was out, sometimes
                contrary to the umpires’ decision and, because of this, was always seen as one Australia’s great sportsmen, both in ability and
                with his attitude towards athletic integrity. He was Australia’s regular Vice Captain in both forms of the game and captained
                the Test and ODI teams, in the absence of regular skippers, Ponting and Steve Waugh, on several occasions.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span> As a talented junior cricketer from country NSW, Gilchrist was selected for the NSW U17 team, before heading over
               to England in 1991 as part of the Australian National Youth Team where he played in Youth Tests and ODI’s and scored
               a century and a fifty in three Youth Tests. Upon his return to Australia, he was accepted into the Australian Cricket Academy and, over the next 12-months,
               represented the Academy in matches against State Second XI teams and toured South Africa where the team played provincial youth teams. Then during the 1992/93 season,
               he was gained selection into the NSW First XI team as a batsman (Phil Emery was the incumbent ‘Keeper) and, despite averaging 30.40 in his debut season, found regular games hard to come by.
